# Password Toggle Project

This project is a simple password toggle that allows users to show or hide the password they are entering into an input field. This feature can be useful for users who want to confirm the password they are entering without having to retype it.

## What is a Password Toggle?

A password toggle is a UI element that allows users to show or hide the password they are entering into an input field. This is usually done by adding an eye icon next to the input field that users can click on to toggle the visibility of the password. When the eye icon is clicked, the password is displayed in clear text. When the eye icon is clicked again, the password is hidden behind asterisks or dots.

## Technologies Used

This project was built using the following technologies:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript

## How to Use

To use the password toggle, simply add the HTML and JavaScript files to your project, and link to them from your web page. Then, add an input field to your page, and add the `toggle-password` class to the input field. Finally, add an eye icon next to the input field with the `toggle-password-icon` class, and you're done!

## Credits

The eye icon used in this project is from the [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icon library.
